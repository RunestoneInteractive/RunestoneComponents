|docname| - HTML format for a fill-in-the-blank component
*********************************************************
This is the HTML format for creating a fill-in-the-blank Runestone Component. For legibility, newlines were added, which aren't allowed in pure JSON. For more information on this problem, see the `Runestone author's manual <https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/overview/Assessments/fitb.html>`_.


Server-side grading
===================
All of the following problem types may be graded either on the client (offering the best user experience due to rapid grading) or on the server (offering better security by not sending solutions to problems across the network, storing them on the server, or assuming the client's grading is correct). Server-side grading requires the use of a server, so it cannot be enabled for books built to function without a server. To request server-side grading, see the documentation below for which elements of the JSON-encoded dictionary to omit. Instead, store the full and complete dictionary in the Runestone database's ``questions.feedback`` field so the server can access this information when it grades a problem.


Dynamic problems
================
The following gives an example of the HTML generated for the following dynamic problem:

.. fillintheblank:: fitb_dynamic_1
    :dyn_vars:
        v.a = Math.floor(rand()*10);
        v.b = Math.floor(rand()*10);
        v.types = {c: Number};

    What is [%= a %] + [%= b %]? :blank:`c`

    -   :c === a + b: Correct; [%= a %] + [%= b %] is [%= c %]. Note that
            [%= ans %] or [%= ans_array[0] %] also works.
        :c === a - b: That's subtraction.
        :c === a * b: That's multiplication.
        :x: I don't know what you're doing.


The reStructuredText used to generate this problem is:

.. literalinclude:: fitb_html_structure.html

    :end-before: The reStructuredText

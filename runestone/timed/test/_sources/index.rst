=====================
Practice Timed Exam
=====================

The following questions make up Set #1 of the Practice Exam Questions. These questions are designed to be similar to those on the AP CSP exam. You should finish these questions within 17 minutes to stay on track with the timing of the actual exam. During the actual exam, you will be provided with the AP CS Reference Sheet, which can be found here.

Click the “Start” button when you are ready to begin the exam. Click the “Pause” button to pause the exam (you will not be able to see the questions when the exam is paused). It will show how much time you have used, but you have unlimited time. Click on the “Finish Exam” button at the end when you are done. The number correct, number wrong, and number skipped will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Feedback for each answer will also be shown as well as your answer.

You will not be able to change your answers after you hit the “Finish Exam” button.

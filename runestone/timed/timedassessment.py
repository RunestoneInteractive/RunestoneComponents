# *******************************
# |docname| - Timed Assessments
# *******************************
# Group together several exercises into an assessment
# Really we should treat this as a kind of assignment.
# But it has to be done indirectly, especially in the case of a selectquestion
# see `runestone/selectquestion/toctree`
# 1. When processing a timed assessment add an assignment to the database for the basecourse
# 2. Before processing the body of the assessment we can set a flag in the environment
#    so that the children will know they are part of an assignment.
# 3. During recursive processing questions should add themselves to the assignment.
#    ``selectquestions`` shoud add themselves as selectquestions so the assignment
#    ends up with the correct fixed number of questions.  The resolution of these
#    will need to be handled by the grader...  The simplest thing may be to send the
#    log the results under the id of the select question rather than the selected question
#    as this will allow for the analysis by competency area.

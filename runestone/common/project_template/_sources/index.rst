=====================
This Is A New Project
=====================

.. Here is were you specify the content and order of your new book.

.. Each section heading (e.g. "SECTION 1: A Random Section") will be
   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the
   :maxdepth: line.

.. Sources can also be included from subfolders of this directory.
   (e.g. "DataStructures/queues.rst").

SECTION 1: Introduction
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Congratulations!   If you can see this file you have probably successfully run the ``runestone init`` command.  If you are looking at this as a source file you should now run ``runestone build``  to generate html files.   Once you have run the build command you can run ``runestone serve`` and then view this in your browser at ``http://localhost:8000``

This is just a sample of what you can do.  The index.rst file is the table of contents for your entire project.  You can put all of your writing in the index, or  you can include additional rst files.  Those files may even be in subdirectories that you can reference using a relative path.

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2

      some/path/myfile.rst


Section 2: Links
::::::::::::::::

Runestone uses the ``restructuredText`` (rst) markup language.  We chose this over markdown largely because rst is extensible.  Nearly all of the basic markup tasks are already handled by restructuredText.  You should check out the docs for the basics of restructuredText (link below). Our extensions are all for the interactive elements.  One key hint about restructuredText:  Its like **Python** -- *indentation matters!*

SECTION 3: Sample Directives
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

ActiveCode
----------

.. activecode:: codeexample1
   :coach:
   :caption: This is a caption

   print("My first program adds a list of numbers")
   myList = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   total = 0
   for num in myList:
       total = total + num
   print(total)

Multiple Choice
---------------

.. mchoice:: question1_2
    :multiple_answers:
    :correct: a,b,d
    :answer_a: red
    :answer_b: yellow
    :answer_c: black
    :answer_d: green
    :feedback_a: Red is a definitely on of the colors.
    :feedback_b: Yes, yellow is correct.
    :feedback_c: Remember the acronym...ROY G BIV.  B stands for blue.
    :feedback_d: Yes, green is one of the colors.

    Which colors might be found in a rainbow? (choose all that are correct)

These are just two of the many interactive components for writing online course materials.  You can see examples of all of them `On our Example Page <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/overview/overview.html>`_

Now feel free to modify this file to start creating your own interactive page.


Section 4: Theme
:::::::::::::::::::

You can override the style rules in the default theme by adding css rules to a file named **theme-overrides.css** (the filename is important - this will replace an existing file). Make sure the file's directory is part of the ``html_static_path``. You can do so by placing it in a folder **_static**, then modifying ``html_static_path`` in conf.py to include that folder:

.. code:: 

    html_static_path =  runestone_static_dirs() + ['_static']


If you want to do more significant changes to the theme, you should copy the files in the runestone/common/project/template/sphinx_bootstrap to a directory like ``_templates/my_theme``. Then make sure these values are set in conf.py:

.. code:: 

    html_theme_path = ["_templates"]
    html_theme = 'my_theme'
